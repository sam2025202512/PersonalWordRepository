As we did not have a meeting for the 1st deliverable we went over our project. After this we concentrated on the deliverable 2. The database design part had some issues which were pointed out by the teacher. For example, translation model was missing note attribute and had some attributes from word, which was due to copying of the table for those models. It was also pointed out that the project is supposed to be stateless so the model user's password_hash should provide a token or something similar. From the ORM code, the quiz part should be removed, as it is not part of the models. This we had already agreed upon but forgot to edit the wiki. We were told to check out the Flask API Project Layout from Lovelace. The balanced contribution between the students regarding the project was emphasized as the future deliverables will have more work. The deliverable 2 wiki will be updated to fix the prevalent issues.
